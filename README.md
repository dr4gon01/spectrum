*A colorful BDD-style test runner for Java*

[Spectrum](https://github.com/greghaskins/spectrum) is inspired by the behavior-driven testing frameworks [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwi-bdd/Kiwi), and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), bringing their expressive syntax and functional style to Java tests. It is a custom runner for [JUnit](http://junit.org/), so it works with many development and reporting tools out of the box.


## Example

> from [ExampleSpecs.java](src/test/java/specs/ExampleSpecs.java)

```java
@RunWith(Spectrum.class)
public class ExampleSpecs {
  {

    describe("A spec", () -> {

      final int foo = 1;

      it("is just a code block that verifies something", () -> {
        assertEquals(1, foo);
      });

      it("can use any assertion library you like", () -> {
        org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(1, foo);
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(true, is(true));
      });

      describe("nested inside a second describe", () -> {

        final int bar = 1;

        it("can reference both scopes as needed", () -> {
          assertThat(bar, is(equalTo(foo)));
        });

      });

      it("can have `it`s and `describe`s in any order", () -> {
        assertThat(foo, is(1));
      });

    });

    describe("A suite using beforeEach and afterEach", () -> {

      final List<String> items = new ArrayList<>();

      beforeEach(() -> {
        items.add("foo");
      });

      beforeEach(() -> {
        items.add("bar");
      });

      afterEach(() -> {
        items.clear();
      });

      it("runs the beforeEach() blocks in order", () -> {
        assertThat(items, contains("foo", "bar"));
        items.add("bogus");
      });

      it("runs them before every spec", () -> {
        assertThat(items, contains("foo", "bar"));
        items.add("bogus");
      });

      it("runs afterEach after every spec", () -> {
        assertThat(items, not(contains("bogus")));
      });

      describe("when nested", () -> {

        beforeEach(() -> {
          items.add("baz");
        });

        it("runs beforeEach and afterEach from inner and outer scopes", () -> {
          assertThat(items, contains("foo", "bar", "baz"));
        });

      });

    });

    describe("A suite using beforeAll", () -> {

      final List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();

      beforeAll(() -> {
        numbers.add(1);
      });

      it("sets the initial state before any specs run", () -> {
        assertThat(numbers, contains(1));
        numbers.add(2);
      });

      describe("and afterAll", () -> {

        afterAll(() -> {
          numbers.clear();
        });

        it("does not reset anything between tests", () -> {
          assertThat(numbers, contains(1, 2));
          numbers.add(3);
        });

        it("so proceed with caution; this *will* leak shared state across specs", () -> {
          assertThat(numbers, contains(1, 2, 3));
        });
      });

      it("cleans up after running all specs in the describe block", () -> {
        assertThat(numbers, is(empty()));
      });

    });

  }
}
```

### Focused Specs

You can focus the runner on particular spec with `fit` or a suite with `fdescribe` so that only those specs get executed.

> from [FocusedSpecs.java](src/test/java/specs/FocusedSpecs.java)

```java
describe("Focused specs", () -> {

  fit("is focused and will run", () -> {
    assertThat(true, is(true));
  });

  it("is not focused and will not run", () -> {
    throw new Exception();
  });

  fdescribe("a focused suite", () -> {

    it("will run", () -> {
      assertThat(true, is(true));
    });

    it("all its specs", () -> {
      assertThat(true, is(true));
    });
  });

  fdescribe("another focused suite, with focused and unfocused specs", () -> {

    fit("will run focused specs", () -> {
      assertThat(true, is(true));
    });

    it("ignores unfocused specs", () -> {
      throw new Exception();
    });
  });
});
```

### Ignored Specs

You can ignore a spec with `xit` or ignore all the specs in a suite with `xdescribe`.

> from [IgnoredSpecs.java](src/test/java/specs/IgnoredSpecs.java)

```java
describe("Ignored specs", () -> {

    xit("is ignored and will not run", () -> {
        throw new Exception();
    });

    it("is not ignored and will run", () -> {
        assertThat(true, is(true));
    });

    xdescribe("an ignored suite", () -> {

        it("will not run", () -> {
            throw new Exception();
        });

        describe("with nesting", () -> {
            it("all its specs", () -> {
                throw new Exception();
            });

            fit("including focused specs", () -> {
                throw new Exception();
            });
        });
    });
});
```

### Common Variable Initialization

The `let` helper function makes it easy to initialize common variables that are used in multiple specs. This also helps work around Java's restriction that closures can only reference `final` variables in the containing scope. Values are cached within a spec, and lazily re-initialized between specs as in [RSpec #let](http://rspec.info/documentation/3.5/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/MemoizedHelpers/ClassMethods.html#let-instance_method).

> from [LetSpecs.java](src/test/java/specs/LetSpecs.java)

```java
describe("The `let` helper function", () -> {

  final Supplier<List<String>> items = let(() -> new ArrayList<>(asList("foo", "bar")));

  it("is a way to supply a value for specs", () -> {
    assertThat(items.get(), contains("foo", "bar"));
  });

  it("caches the value so it doesn't get created multiple times for the same spec", () -> {
    assertThat(items.get(), is(sameInstance(items.get())));

    items.get().add("baz");
    items.get().add("blah");
    assertThat(items.get(), contains("foo", "bar", "baz", "blah"));
  });

  it("creates a fresh value for every spec", () -> {
    assertThat(items.get(), contains("foo", "bar"));
  });
});
```

## Supported Features

Spectrum moving toward a `1.0` release with close alignment to Jasmine's test declaration API. The library already supports a nice subset of those features:

- [x] `describe`
- [x] `it`
- [x] `beforeEach` / `afterEach`
- [x] `beforeAll` / `afterAll`
- [x] `fit` / `fdescribe`
- [x] `xit` / `xdescribe`

### Non-Features

Unlike some BDD-style frameworks, Spectrum is _only_ a test runner. Assertions, expectations, mocks, and matchers are the purview of other libraries.

## Getting Started

Spectrum is available as a [package on jCenter](https://bintray.com/greghaskins/maven/Spectrum/view), so make sure you have jCenter declared as a repository in your build config. Future inclusion in Maven Central (see [#12](https://github.com/greghaskins/spectrum/issues/12)) will make this even easier.

### Dependencies

 - JUnit 4
 - Java 8 (for your tests; systems under test can use older versions)

### Gradle

Make sure you have the jCenter repository in your [init script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html) or project `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
```

Then add the Spectrum dependency for your tests:

```groovy
dependencies {
  testCompile 'com.greghaskins:spectrum:0.7.1'
}

```

### Maven

Make sure you have the jCenter repository in your global `settings.xml` or project `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jcenter</id>
        <url>http://jcenter.bintray.com</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Then add Spectrum as a dependency with `test` scope in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.greghaskins</groupId>
      <artifactId>spectrum</artifactId>
      <version>0.7.1</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```
